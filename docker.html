		<h2>DB2/DSM Docker Container</h2> <br>
			<p>The goal of this project was to make data more presentable to our customers. The first step to achieving this was getting DB2 and IBM's Data Service Manager into our container. Next we wanted to make unique instances of our Data Service Manager with user specific workloads so that it would more presentable and less cluttered when showcasing to our customers. We were able to achieve this by making a Docker container per workload.  </p> <br>

			<h2>Private Docker Registry</h2> <br>
			<p>Our next goal was to make our workload containers sharable internally within IBM without being hosted by dockerhub. This means that only users within IBM and on the same network can pull and push these containers. To achieve this we kept a Docker container running in a VM called Registry 2.1, which is a container whose sole purpose is to store Docker containers. Next we had to set up certificates to allow pushing and pulling to specific ip addresses. Lastly, we mounted the folder that contains all the containers to our VM, so all containers will be backed up if our container malfunctions.</p> <br>
