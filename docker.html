		<h2>Private Docker Registry</h2>
			<p>Set up an internal private Docker Registry within IBM for secure data transferring through the use of Registry 2.1 and certificates. This allows others within the network to pull and push to the registry if they have the right keys and certificates. </p>
		<h2>DB2/DSM Docker Container</h2>
			<p>Created a docker container with DSM, DB2, and the corresponding user specific work load. This makes presentation and organization to customers much cleaner </p>
