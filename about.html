		<h2>Hello my name is Aaron,</h2>
			<p>I'm a senior attending University of California, San Diego with a degree in
			Computer Science (B.S). My goals are to get more experience in a  real working environment as well as further my knowledge in programming. <br> <br>

			I am from the Bay Area and love nice views that the world has to offer :). I like to work on side projects, more so with others than by myself.
